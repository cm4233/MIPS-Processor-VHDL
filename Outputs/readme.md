The implemented MIPS Processor was tested by running RC5 encryption and decryption algorithms. The simulation and FPGA outputs for both encryption and decryption can be found in this folder. They are verified using examples from the original paper “The RC5 Encryption Algorithm.” By Ronald L. Rivest.
